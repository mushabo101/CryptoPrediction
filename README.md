# CryptoPrediction
This project only for fun and education not financial advice.
Nowdays cryptocurrency more popullar thank stocks, forex, and any exchange
Cryptocurrency is very volatile assets/price, technical, news, sentiment drive the price.
I just try Machine Learning to predict price of cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), and Binance (BNB) the most popullar and top marketcap.
Datasets cryptocurrency as historical data can find at : https://www.coingecko.com/en , we can choose any cryptocurrency and download dataset in CSV files.
Machine learning algorithm that i choose linear regression, and split data as train and test sets by ratio 85 : 15 percent. the accuracy that almost 85-98%. but in real many factors affect to prediction it self. also other algoritm have to try and compare the prediction which one is better?.
